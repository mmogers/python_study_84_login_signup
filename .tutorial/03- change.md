# Change Data

Now that we have a dictionary we can give users the option to edit their data. I'm going to make it so that the change password option is given on the successful login screen.

ðŸ‘‰ First, I need a quick `change.html` page to create the form:  


```html
<form method="post" action="/changePass">
  
  <p>Username: <input type="text" name="username" required></p>
  <p>New Password: <input type="password" name="newPassword"></p>
  
  <button type="submit">Change</button>
</form>

```


ðŸ‘‰ Next, I'm going to add the form to my successful login screen.  That's the `yup` subroutine. To do this I have:
1. Assigned the gif to a page variable instead of returning it.
2. Borrowed the file open & read code from my `index` subroutine and adapted it to open & read the `change.html` file.
3. Used `+=` in the `page += f.read()` line to add the contents of the `change.html` file to the successful login page.

```python
@app.route("/yup")
def yup():
  page = """<img src="static/yup.gif" height="100">"""
  f = open("change.html", "r")
  page += f.read()
  f.close()
  return page

```
Now when I login, I get the change password form underneath my successful login gif.

ðŸ‘‰ However, this won't do anything without an `app.route`, so let's write that next.

## App Route
This code will update the database with any new password set.  It will also display the updated password on the screen *for testing only*. I don't need to tell you not to do this IRL right?

```python
@app.route("/changePass", methods=["POST"])

def change():
  form = request.form
  
  db[request.form["username"]] ["password"]= request.form["newPassword"]
  return f"""Password changed to {request.form['newPassword']}"""

```

Changing a password now should get you a message like this:

### Now, we can test this out by changing passwords and then trying to login with the new password.

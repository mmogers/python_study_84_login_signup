# Store and Use Data

ðŸ‘‰ To replace the dictionary with a database, first I need to import repl.db.


```python
from flask import Flask, request, redirect
from replit import db

```

## Storing The Data
ðŸ‘‰ Next, I'm going to delete the line that defines the dictionary and change the assignment of the next two lines to store the data in the database instead.

```python
db["david"] = {"password" : "Baldy1"}
db["katie"] = {"password" : "k8t"}

```
ðŸ‘‰ Now **run the program** to add the data to the dictionary. I can tell that it's worked because the database pane now shows 2 keys:
![](resources/02_db21.png)

ðŸ‘‰ Then **comment out these lines** - you don't want to add the data more than once.

```python
#db["david"] = {"password" : "Baldy1"}
#db["katie"] = {"password" : "k8t"}

```

## Using The Data

ðŸ‘‰ Now I'm going to change my `login` subroutine to reference the database instead of the `users{}` dictionary.

```python
@app.route('/login', methods=["POST"])
def login():
  form = request.form
  try:
    if db[request.form["username"]]   ["password"]== request.form["password"]:
      return redirect("/yup")
    else:
      return redirect("/nope")
  except:
    return redirect("/nope")
```
